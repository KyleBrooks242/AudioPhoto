PicSound
Contributors: Wesley Huber, Kyle Brooks, Cameron Monaghan
FUNCTIONALITY: Hear selected images come to life, and manipulate the audio’s tempo via a smart phone.

Phone Functionality:
REQUIRES: Wifi connection and MRMR iOS application
SETUP:To enable a smartphone to enjoy accelerometer functionality, download the MRMR application for iOS. Run PicSound application through JEM2. You will then be prompted with a message “OSC Server started:”. Following this, the program prints to the console the IP address and port. Now you can open the MRMR application. On the opening screen on MRMR, select “Add a Server”, then click “Add server manually”. You are then prompted to type in the IP address, type in the IP address shown from the JEM2 editor console. Then press “Connect”. It should bring you straight into MRMR’s UI to send messages to the computer. We will be using the accelerometer, so if it is not shown already, use the MRMR app tips to help you add the accelerometer widget. 
MECHANICS: Aim the phone directly downwards to keep tempo of audio at a slow rate. As you angle your phone upwards, the tempo subsequently increases till your smart phone is directly pointed upwards.

Application:
If you are reading this that means you have successfully gathered our assets. Now open JEM2 editor and run ‘main.py’. Once the program is running you will see a GUI where you will be prompted to select an image. Select and uploading the image will process the image and bring you to the next GUI which will play and control your auditorial image. Here you can choose the sound type, play/pause the sound, and manipulate the sound tempo with your smart phone.
